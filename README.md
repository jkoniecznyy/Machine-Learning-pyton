# Machine-Learning-pyton
In this repo I put the last two tasks from a Machine Learning classes at UE Katowice.
I'm not putting the tasks 1-6 cause I think they are less fun to watch, but if you wanna check them you can go to the repo of my teacher - [Przemysław Sekuła](https://github.com/PrzemekSekula/DeepLearningClasses1). 

Task 7 - we had to do our own k-means clustering implementation from scratch. I spent a week on it and I'm pretty proud of the results.

Taks 8 - a practical introduction to transfer learning. I chose the [Intel Image Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) and the recommended Xception network. Most of the code isn't written by me, I just had to understand it and put a few lines in a few places. At the end of the file I had to write a function that allows me to chceck on my own examples how the model works with real images and I think that's the best part. So at the end of this pretty long file you can find my own pictures ploted with the model predictions.
